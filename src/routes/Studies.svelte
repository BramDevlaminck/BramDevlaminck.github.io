				I'm currently finishing the last year of my masters degree. This allows me more to focus on doing more research in IT and specialise in certain disciplines.
				An example of the research I'm working on is my thesis where I am exploring different possible index structures to integrate into <a href='https://unipept.ugent.be/' class="font-medium text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-500 hover:underline">Unipept</a>.
				This is a tool developed by Ghent University that performs metaproteomics and metagenomics analyses.
				These alternative index structures would not only allow to perform the existing analyses even faster, but also allow to analyse a wider range of peptide samples.

				During these 3 years I obtained a broad knowledge about the fundaments of computer science together with a strong basis of math. I completed this programme last year with great distinction.
				One of the main focuses of this programme is obtaining a broad base knowledge and knowing how to apply it in practice. This is done by the many projects we have to make throughout the semester.
				Furthermore producing something <i>that works</i> isn't good enough. There is a strong focus on code quality and performance of the created application.
